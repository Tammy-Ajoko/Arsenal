### What I learned

I learned how to create hover states on an image and also how to rotate an icon of which I added to the ethereum and clock icon

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.hover-icon{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: hsla(178, 100%, 50%,0.6);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    opacity: 0;
    border-radius: 10px;
    transition: opacity 0.25s;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm learning how to pay closer attention to details and also making my site respomsive.I also want to improve on my code optimization and time consumption.
