### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I had to learn how to use media quaries in order to make it responsive mobile.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
    @media only screen and (max-width: 500px){
      [class*='box1']{
        width:fit-content;
        flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
        padding: 10px;
        text-align: center;
        align-items: center;
      }
    }
```

### Continued development

I'd really like to write cleaner codes and find more efficient and better ways of tackling a problem.
